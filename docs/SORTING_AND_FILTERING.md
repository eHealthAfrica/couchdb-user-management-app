Sorting and Filtering
---------------------



* Sorting:\
For sorting users presented in the table, the UMS relies on couchDB views.\
A single view is expected for each fields that would be used for sorting.\
The expected view is characterised as follows:

Design Document: ```_design/couchdb-user-management-app```

Index name: ```by_[FIELD NAME]```

where ```[FIELD_NAME]``` represents the name of the field.\
For instance, if we were to sort by the field ```ROLE```, a view having an index name of 
```by_role``` is expected to be found in the design document ```_design/couchdb-user-management-app``` of the 
```_users``` database.
